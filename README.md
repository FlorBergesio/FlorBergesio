## Hello World!
I'm Flor Bergesio, a software engineer, web development enthusiast and videogame lover

- I recently graduated from university
- I started as a PHP freelancer, and have over 4 years of experience working with PHP core, WordPress and Laravel
- I'm currently learning all things javascript: React, Node and all that good stuff
- I'm working as a web developer remotely, looking forward to relocate
- Partially unrelated fun fact: I love to create! Of course I love coding, as it allows me to create anything, but I also love to draw, paint, 3D sculpt and anything craft-related
